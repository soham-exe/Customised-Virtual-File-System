COMMAND=man
NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [command_name]

DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is
       the name of a command, utility or function.

       The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found
       and displayed.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the ls command.
END

COMMAND=ls
NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the files in the current directory (the Virtual
       File System).

       For each file, it displays the Inode Number, File Name, and Actual
       File Size.

EXAMPLES
       ls
           Lists all files currently created in the system.
END

COMMAND=clear
NAME
       clear - clear the terminal screen

SYNOPSIS
       clear

DESCRIPTION
       clear clears your screen if this is possible, including its scrollback
       buffer. It looks up the terminal type in the environment and then
       calls the system command to clear the screen.
END

COMMAND=exit
NAME
       exit - cause the shell to exit

SYNOPSIS
       exit

DESCRIPTION
       The exit command terminates the Custom Virtual File System (CVFS)
       session.

       Before exiting, it releases all allocated resources, including Inodes
       and memory buffers, ensuring a clean shutdown.
END

COMMAND=creat
NAME
       creat - open and possibly create a file

SYNOPSIS
       creat [file_name] [permission]

DESCRIPTION
       creat() attempts to create a file with the specified name and per‐
       mission mode.

       If the file already exists, an error is returned. If successful, it re‐
       turns a non-negative integer termed a file descriptor.

OPTIONS
       permission
           The permission mode for the new file:
           1  Read permissions only.
           2  Write permissions only.
           3  Read and Write permissions.

EXAMPLES
       creat Demo.txt 3
           Creates a file named Demo.txt with Read & Write permissions.
END

COMMAND=read
NAME
       read - read from a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       read [file_descriptor] [bytes_to_read]

DESCRIPTION
       read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd
       into the buffer.

       On success, the number of bytes read is returned, and the file position
       is advanced by this number.

EXAMPLES
       read 3 10
           Reads 10 bytes from the file associated with File Descriptor 3.
END

COMMAND=write
NAME
       write - write to a file descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       write [file_descriptor] [bytes_to_write]

DESCRIPTION
       write() writes up to count bytes from the buffer to the file referred
       to by the file descriptor fd.

       The number of bytes written may be less than count if there is
       insufficient space in the underlying file system.

EXAMPLES
       write 3 5
           Writes 5 bytes to the file associated with File Descriptor 3.
END

COMMAND=unlink
NAME
       unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to

SYNOPSIS
       unlink [file_name]

DESCRIPTION
       unlink() deletes a name from the filesystem. If that name was the last
       link to a file and no processes have the file open, the file is de‐
       leted and the space it was using is made available for reuse.

EXAMPLES
       unlink Demo.txt
           Deletes the file named Demo.txt.
END

COMMAND=lseek
NAME
       lseek - reposition read/write file offset

SYNOPSIS
       lseek [file_descriptor] [offset] [whence]

DESCRIPTION
       lseek() repositions the file offset of the open file descriptor fd to
       the argument offset according to the directive whence.

OPTIONS
       whence
           0  (START) The file offset is set to offset bytes.
           1  (CURRENT) The file offset is set to its current location plus
              offset bytes.
           2  (END) The file offset is set to the size of the file plus off‐
              set bytes.

EXAMPLES
       lseek 3 0 0
           Resets the cursor of File Descriptor 3 to the beginning of the
           file (START).
END

COMMAND=stat
NAME
       stat - display file status

SYNOPSIS
       stat [file_name]

DESCRIPTION
       stat() displays detailed statistics and metadata about a file refer‐
       enced by its name.

       Information includes the File Name, Inode Number, File Size, Link
       Count, and Permissions.

EXAMPLES
       stat Demo.txt
           Shows metadata for the file Demo.txt.
END

COMMAND=fstat
NAME
       fstat - display file status by descriptor

SYNOPSIS
       fstat [file_descriptor]

DESCRIPTION
       fstat() is identical to stat(), except that the file about which infor‐
       mation is to be retrieved is specified by the file descriptor fd.

EXAMPLES
       fstat 3
           Shows metadata for the file open at File Descriptor 3.
END

COMMAND=help
NAME
       help - display information about builtin commands

SYNOPSIS
